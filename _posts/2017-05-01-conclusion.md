This essay series has explored how different aspect's that make up a selection of film form, Specifically mise en scene, cinematography, editing and sound and how they can emphasize an idea or theme in a selection of films. 

In _Be kind Rewind_(2008) the use of camera distance, Specifically mid shot can help to emphasize the characters actions and color can be used to ground the world films in a imitation of reality Which helps emphasize the theme of Community and people inside the community

With _We Are the Best!_(2014) The Punk clothing of the main characters compared to the rest of characters is used to show the reblius nature that the characters have and how different they want to be from everybody else this is also shown though their performance with blocking 

_The Grand Budapest Hotel_(2014) uses continuity editing to give the scenes a sense of structure for example in the opening sequence every shot is connected to each other. This contrasts with the rhythm and the short shots in the scene where Mr gustav is rushing to see one of lovers funeral which give an sense of chaos    

In _Spirited Away_(2003) the films soundtrack to emphasize what the character is going though when she is trying to go down the stairs and using sound effects such as squelching and footsteps to help build a unique world tie into the theme: creating a unique world that  main character get forced into.
