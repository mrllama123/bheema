> "Film Editing is the process by which different images and shots are linked to-gether"(Corrigan and White,134)

Chaos within a picturesque world is an theme that is explored in _The Grand Budapest Hotel_(2014) This is helped by the use of editing.In this short eassey i will look into the use of contiues editing and pacing and how it relates to this theme.

The editing in _The Grand Budapest Hotel_ is created in a way that each shot happens to have structure. In other words the editing follows the continuity editing style.Corrigan and White describe continuity editing as  "each shot has a continuos relationship with to the next shot". In fig1 sequence this is shown by the old man writer narrator talking about the hotel to a shot where the hotel is shown, then a younger version of the narrator starts to describe different parts of the hotel with the shots reflecting what he is talking about. This helps to set the scene and world of the budapest hotel in a logical manar.

In contrast to this is the scene in fig 2 where there is still a contiues order to the scene but the short shot takes and fast camera movement help to give the scene a sense of chaos.This is shown though the short shots of the car moving rapidly to it destination changing angle each time. This creates a certian rythim to the scene. Rythim in terms of editing can be defined as how shots are paced together by how quick the cut of each shot is made (Corrigan and White,2014,158-159) Therefore beacuse each shot take is short it creates a fast paced rythim which gives the seqence a sence of urgancy. This is also further illstrated when the car stops and Mr. Gustave and Zero rush out into the manor to get too Mr. Gustave Old Lovers coffin as they are going to the coffin short shots are used as well untill they get to the Mr. Gustave Old Lovers coffin becuase they have reached there destination.
