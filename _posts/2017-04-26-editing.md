> "Film Editing is the process by which different images and shots are linked to-gether"(Corrigan and White,134)

Chaos within a picturesque world is an theme that is explored in _The Grand Budapest Hotel_(2014) This is helped by the use of editing.In this short eassey i will look into different aspects of editing that is used in _The Grand Budapest Hotel_.

The editing in _The Grand Budapest Hotel_ is created in a way that each shot happens to have structure. In other words the editing folows the continunty edidting style.Corrigan and White descibe continunty edidting as  "each shot has a continuos relationship with to the next shot". In fig1 sequence this is shown by the old man writer narrator talking about the hotel to a shot where the hotel is shown, then a younger version of the narrator starts to describe different parts of the hotel with the shots reflecting what he is talking about. There is continuity between each shot because connects with the last shot
