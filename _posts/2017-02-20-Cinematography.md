title: Cinematography and community in Be Kind Rewind

For the purposes of this essay I have used the following definition of "Cinematography: Motion picture photography, literally 'writing in movement'"(Corrigan and White 463). The central theme in _Be Kind Rewind_ (2008) is that of community and how those within it interact with one another. This is shown through the use of Cinematography in two different ways,which are the  the camera distance of the shots and color pallet of the film .This essay will argue that these two aspects of cinematography are crucial in portraying the central theme of community in the film.

Corrigan and White (2014 109) define camera distance in making of each shot as the distance that the subjects are in relation to the camera. In terms of _Be Kind Rewind_ (2008) cinematography is used in terms of camera distance to give the viewer a bird's eye view of the overall local community in which the movie is located. This is crucial to the movie in terms of establishing time and place in the movie which the viewer can use as a reference point for the rest of the movie. Without this the viewer would have little idea of the extent and nature of the community.

Camera distance is also used in Figure 2 where there are examples of how the films camera puts emphasis on the characters and the situations they get into within the community. An example of this is fig2, which uses a medium distance shot to show the three main characters (Jerry, Mike and Mr Fletcher) and some kids in the vhs store. This shot helps to give enough detail of the characters expressions and interactions but also gives context to where the characters are in their community through showing the inside of the vhs store, looking out the window to the outside street where it is located. Corrigan and White(2014,111) define a medium shot as "describes a middle ground in which we see some background detail in the frame. The human body is framed from waist and hips up". In fig2 the viewer sees the community members from at least the waist up frames the background of the street outside the window where the community lives.

The second method of cinematography used in _Be Kind Rewind_ (2008) to portray community is through colour. Corrigan and White( 114) state "Color profoundly affects our experience of a film shot"
The color of a shot is often overlooked by the viewer because of its subtlety but it can have a profound effect on the film. With _Be Kind Rewind_ (2008) it tends to use more muted colors (see fig3, where the colors are all even and no particular color is highlighted above the rest. This  helps to give a realistic impression to the film because no color effects are used. Corrigan and White(471) define realism as how truthful a picture is of society, people or any other part of real world life. What makes this films colors realistic, is that in the real world colors generally tend to be more even rather focus one particular color or tone. This helps the viewer understand that this film is based on the real world and grounds the characters in believability.

In Contrast in _Fantastic Mr fox_(2009) it tends to use a more stylized approach where it focuses one color for example fig4's shot is prominently yellow/orange from the background being an orange color to the character and foliage having a yellow tint to it as well. This helps the viewer understand that this shot is not trying to be realistic but rather a unrealistic shot that's trying to imitate a world not based in reality.
