>"Cinematography: Motion picture photography, literally 'writing in movement'"(Corrigan and White, 463)


One of _Be Kind Rewinds_(2008) themes is, Community and people inside the community. This is
shown Through the use of Cinematography in two different ways, The color pallet of the film and the distance of the shots.


Corrigan and white(109) define camera distance as the distance that the subjects are in relation
to the camera. In terms of Be Kind Rewind most of the film is Centered around the characters and local community This is shown by the fact that there is only one aerial shot shot (see fig 1) in the entire movie which is The only time that the film shows the wider world which is only used to set location of the film. fig2 and fig3 are some of the examples of how the films Camera puts emphases of the characters and the situations they get into. an example of this is fig2 which uses a medium shot Corrian and White(111) define a medium shot as "describes a middle ground in which we see some background detail in the frame. The human body is framed from waist and hips up". In fig2 the viewer sees the three main characters (Jerry, Mike and Mr Fletcher) and some kids in the vhs store. This shot helps to give enough detail of the characters expressions and interactions but also give context to where the characters are in world. Which the location (vhs store) is located inside the community (see fig3) showing that this shot is about the people inside the community.

>"Color profoundly effects our experience of a film shot" Corrigan And White(114)

The color of a shot is often an overlooked because of its subtlety but it can have a profound effect on the film with _Be Kind Rewind_ it tends to use more muted colors(see fig1) where the colors are all even and no particular color is highlighted above the rest which helps to give a realistic impression to the film. Corrigan and White(471) define Realism as how truthful a picture is of society, people or any other part of real world life. What makes This films colors realistic, is that in the real world colors generally tend to be more even rather one particular color. Which helps the viewer understand that this film is based off the real world and grounds the characters in believability.

In Contrast in _Fantastic Mr fox_(2009) it tends to use a more stylized approach where it focuses one color for example fig4's shot is prominently yellow/orange from the background being an orange color to the character and foliage having a yellow tint to it as well. This helps the viewer understand that this shot is not trying to be realistic but rather a unrealistic shot that's trying to imitate a world not based in reality.
