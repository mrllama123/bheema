> "quote about mise en scene"

One of the central themes in _We Are The Best_(2014) is being diffrnet in a society that
exspects you to act and be a certian way. Mise en scene really helps to exsemplify this in two ways,
The contrast between the main characters clothes compared to everybody else and How the performance of the main charcters also compliment the contrst between the main characters and eveyone else


- get definition for clothing
- exsamples of it
- how it ties into idea

Costumes defined By Corrgan and White(77) are clothing and other realted things that are worn by the actors,
They can help to describe characters motivations and actions. _We Are the Best_ uses clothing as a way to illsyrait
that the characters are rebelling agaest the norm and trying to set apart from the rest of society. fig 1 shows us  There is a clear diffrence between what the girls are wearing two of them are wearing very plain and simplistic clothing that is synomus with 80's style but the two others girls (which are two of the main characters) contrast that by wearing jearsys that are a bit too big for them and also having diffrent hair styles, mowhawk and short hair.This sets them apart from the two girls clearly showing that they want to be diffrent.
