> "Mise-en-scene refers to those elements of a movie scene that are put in posistion before the films actually begins"(Corrigan and White,64)

One of the central themes in _We Are The Best_ (2014) is about being different in a society that expects you to act and be a certain way. Mise en scene really helps to exemplify this in two ways. The first is the contrast between the main characters clothes compared to everybody else's’ and the second is how the performance of the one of the main characters contrasts with the way the other characters portray themselves. 

Costumes defined By Corrigan and White(77) are clothing and other related things that are worn by the actors,They can help to describe characters motivations and actions. _We Are the Best_ (2014) uses clothing as a way to illustrate that the characters are rebelling against the norm and trying to set apart from the rest of society. Figure1 shows there is a clear difference between what the girls are wearing. Two of them are wearing very plain and simplistic clothing that is synonymous with 1980's style but the two others girls (which are two of the main characters) contrast that by wearing jerseys that are a bit too big for them and also having different hairstyles such as mohawk and short hair. This sets them apart from the two other girls who have similar haircuts(see fig2) and through this mise en scene aspect clearly shows that they want to be different.

The performance brought by the three main characters helped to show how different the characters were in relation to the rest of the characters. Corrigan and White(73) describe performance as the ways that actors use language, expressions and body gestures. In Figure 2 there is a contrast between the girl and the adults in the party where the girl is not enjoying the party but everyone else is. This is shown through use of blocking which Corrigan and White(76) describe as the placement of actors in the setting. In the film the girl is all by herself on the couch but all of the adults are talking and laughing each other. This suggests that the girl doesn't want to be there and she sees herself as different then the rest of the adults in the party.
